CodePrinter
============
CodePrinter's goal is pretty self-explanatory: to make it easier to print out
code. Many IDE's don't really do code printing right. They typically don't have
code highlighting, don't allow you to change your font/font size, and/or add
silly headers/footers on your code. CodePrinter makes it easy. Simply copy your
code into the text box, select your desired font, font size, and programming
language (more languages to come) and hit print.

Development Status
==================
CodePrinter is under active development. A few key features need to be added
before a version 1.0 is released.
