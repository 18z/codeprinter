CodePrinter
============
CodePrinter's goal is pretty self-explanatory: to make it easier to print out code on paper. Many IDE's either don't allow you to print or have some weird quirks like adding unneccessary headers and footers, not allowing you to change your font size, or not providing syntax highlighting on your printout.

CodePrinter makes it easy. Simply copy your code into the text box, select your desired font, font size, and syntax highlighting theme and then hit print.
