Code Printer
============
Code Printer's goal is pretty self-explanatory: to make it easier to print out
code. I'm not really satisfied with the way many IDE's and text editors
print code out. They either put silly headers on it, make the text giant, or
don't provide code highlighting. The printing user interface typically leaves
much to be desired as well.

Development Status
==================
Code Printer is in active development. At this point, the code does not perform
code highlighting, but that feature will be coming soon.
