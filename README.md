Code Printer
============
Code Printer's goal is pretty self-explanatory: to make it easier to print out
code. I'm not really satisfied with the way many IDE's and text editors
print code out. They either put silly headers on it, make the text too large, or
don't provide code highlighting. The printing user interface typically leaves
much to be desired as well. With Code Printer, you will be able to paste your
code into a text box, select a language, and print your code.

Development Status
==================
Code Printer is under active development. There are a few bugs that need to be
fixed (please check out the issues section) and a couple of features that need
to be added before a version 1.0 is released.
