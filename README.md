Code Printer
============
Code Printer's goal is pretty self-explanatory: to make it easier to print out
code. I'm not really satisfied with the way many IDE's and text editors
print code out. They either put silly headers on it, make the text giant, or
don't provide code highlighting. The printing user interface typically leaves
much to be desired as well.

Status
============
This project is very much a work in progress. As it stands currently, the
program is very buggy and not at all useful. There's a lot of work to be done
still. Please excuse the Javascript, I'm still trying to figure out how to
do paging and maintain line integrity.
